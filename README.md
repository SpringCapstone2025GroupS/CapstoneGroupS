## Project Overview

On January 11th, 2023, a failure in the FAA's NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) system grounded all U.S. flights for two hours. While NOTAMs provide essential flight information, the sheer volume and inclusion of less relevant details make it difficult for pilots to identify critical notices.

## :star2: Objectives

This project aims to design a system that:
- Fetches all applicable NOTAMs for a flight, given its departure and destination airports within the continental United States.

- Displays the NOTAMs in a prioritized manner, highlighting the most critical information to help pilots identify potential hazards.
