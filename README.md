## Project Overview

On January 11th, 2023, a failure in the FAA's NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) system grounded all U.S. flights for two hours. While NOTAMs provide essential flight information, the sheer volume and inclusion of less relevant details make it difficult for pilots to identify critical notices.
